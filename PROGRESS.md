# PROGRESS — RFC-MACP-0013 canonical commitment hash (PR 5 of 5)

Plan (read-only, sibling repo): `../multiagentcoordinationprotocol/plans/cross-repo/macp-sdk-typescript-rfc-macp-0013.md`
Verified against `main` @ `ec51059` (plan's stated baseline).

## Repo map (relevant slice only)

- `src/types.ts:144-166` — `CommitmentRef` / `CommitmentPayload` interfaces (camelCase, no `?` except `policyVersion`, `outcomePositive`, `supersedes`).
- `src/envelope.ts:73-119` — `buildCommitmentRef` (:73-75, currently zero-validation pass-through), `buildCommitmentPayload` (:91-119, `supersedes` branch at :117).
- `src/proto-registry.ts:106-117` — prior art for the D2.2 proto3-bool-default trap (`Commitment.outcome_positive`), cite in PR body.
- `src/validation.ts` — existing validator idiom (`validateRequiredField`, `validateSessionId`) to extend in Phase 2.
- `src/index.ts` — wildcard barrel (`export * from './X'`), coverage-excluded.
- `vitest.config.ts` — coverage floors lines 94 / branches 88 / functions 90 / statements 94; `include: ['tests/**/*.test.ts']`, no config change needed for Phase 3.
- `Makefile` `verify-fixtures` — globs `tests/conformance/*.json` only (flat, non-recursive) against spec repo's `schemas/conformance/`; confirmed `tests/vectors/` is invisible to it, no Makefile change needed.
- `.prettierignore` — `dist/ proto/ coverage/ docs/ *.proto`; Phase 3 adds `tests/vectors/`.
- Spec vectors (source of truth for Phase 3): `../multiagentcoordinationprotocol/schemas/conformance/cmt-hash/*.json`, at spec commit `646c3dd`.

## Phase status

### Phase 1 — `src/commitment-hash.ts` — **Status: DONE**
- Verifier: Opus, 2 rounds (round 1: PASS-with-gaps → Sonnet fixer closed G1-G4/R1 → round 2: PASS, mutation-verified).
- Files touched: `src/commitment-hash.ts` (new), `tests/commitment-hash.test.ts` (new, 27 tests), `src/index.ts` (+1 barrel line).
- Commit: `ee131bc` — **local only, not pushed.** Verifier recommendation: accumulate toward the plan's closing PR rather than ship standalone, since `commitmentHash` becomes public API via the barrel before Phase 3 proves it against real spec vectors, and this repo's release-please workflow triggers on every push to `main`.
- Informational (not blocking, logged to `ASSUMPTIONS.md`): `canonicalizeCommitmentPayload` is also barrel-exported (public API); `supersedes: null`/non-object hashes identically to an empty-string ref (out-of-contract input, D3-permitted).
- What's next: Phase 2.

### Phase 2 — validate `commitmentHash` in `buildCommitmentRef` + `buildCommitmentPayload`'s `supersedes` branch — **Status: DONE**
- Verifier: Opus, 2 rounds (round 1: GAPS on 1 real item (stale `docs/api/envelope.md` example) + 1 cosmetic → Sonnet fixer closed both → round 2: PASS).
- Files touched: `src/validation.ts` (+`validateCommitmentHash`), `src/envelope.ts` (both call sites wired, JSDoc updated), `docs/api/envelope.md`, `tests/unit/envelope.test.ts`, `tests/unit/validation.test.ts`.
- Commit: `6d83b9d` (`feat!:` — behavior break, callers passing an invalid `commitmentHash` string now get `MacpSessionError` instead of silent pass-through) — **local only, not pushed**, same accumulate-toward-closing-PR reasoning as Phase 1, reinforced: this phase is itself a breaking change, so shipping it standalone ahead of Phase 3 would mean two breaking-ish releases where one suffices.
- Residual, out-of-phase-scope holes flagged by the verifier (not fixed, by design — logging for the closing PR body, not blocking Phase 3):
  - `ProtoRegistry.encodeKnownPayload` remains an unvalidated wire path for a hand-built `CommitmentPayload` that bypasses `buildCommitmentPayload` entirely (demonstrated live by `tests/unit/proto-registry.test.ts:132`'s `'abc123'` fixture, which is correctly untouched by this phase).
  - `buildCommitmentRef` validates `commitmentHash` but not `sessionId` (asymmetric; `validateSessionId` exists but isn't called here — plan only asked for the hash).
  - `src/envelope.ts:122`'s `if (input.supersedes)` is a truthy check, not `!== undefined`; `supersedes: null` (reachable only from JS/decoded payloads, not from TS) silently skips both validation and assignment in the builder, while `canonicalizeCommitmentPayload` (Phase 1) treats `null` as present via `!== undefined` — a builder/hasher inconsistency worth Phase 3 being aware of when building vector-runner payloads.
- What's next: Phase 3.

### Phase 3 — vector runner (`tests/vectors/cmt-hash/`, outside the `verify-fixtures` drift gate) — **Status: TODO**

## Closing-PR plan

Per Phase 1's verifier recommendation: land Phases 1-3 as **one PR** (public surface appears once, already vector-proven) rather than three. Confirm this at Phase 3's closeout before invoking `/ship`.
